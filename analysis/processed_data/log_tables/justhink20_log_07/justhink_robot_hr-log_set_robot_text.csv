0.0,"Look at this! This is a map of Switzerland. You see many mountains, and in all of 
the mountains there is gold! You also see buildings, but they are not important."
17.029150009155273,"In this game, we have to build a railway network to help the miners go from any mine
to any other. Our goal is to spend as little money as possible to build the railways."
32.282198429107666,"Before we play together, let's see how to interact with the game. You see here
two gold mines, with a possible connection between them, shown as a gray track."
47.33892822265625,"Let's connect these two gold mines to each other, so that the miners can travel
between them. For this, click on one mine, and go to the other without releasing!"
67.40084147453308,"This railway costs 3 francs! In this game we consider the costs of the tracks:
every time we build a track, it costs something. We want to spend as little as we can."
86.43079423904419,"Now, imagine you want to remove the connections and start connecting again from 
scratch. For this, you can press the eraser button on the right. Try it!"
103.46781587600708,"Now, there is no connection between the mountains: miners can't go between them. Let's
connect again, and when you are done, propose your connection by pressing the submit button!"
127.051114320755,Perfect! You got a hold of it. We can begin!
136.82829999923706,"Now, letâ€™s start the game! Go ahead and connect the gold mines to
each other so that miners can go from any mine to any other by some path."
150.8168866634369,"Try to spend as little as possible to build the tracks.
Please give it a try by yourself, later, we will do it together!"
271.1763460636139,"Okay, so, let's try to connect these different gold mines to help the miners go
between them. Try to spend as few francs as you can. Give it a try!"
326.08103680610657,"So you are done with the second one. What about these gold mines? Let's connect
 them as cheaply as possible, while miners can travel between them. Go ahead!"
399.37226963043213,"Okay, let's try for this one now. Please connect them while spending as little as
possible. There is only one more to go before we do it together. Good luck!"
439.10476303100586,"So, for this final time, please connect these different mines as
cheaply as you can, by yourself. Then, we will play together!"
475.03563117980957,"Now, we do it together! We need to connect the mines, so that miners can travel from
any mine to any other. Our goal is to spend as few francs as possible to build tracks!"
492.5784635543823,"We have got only four attempts to find the cheapest connection, so let's try our best! When
you think it is ready to be submitted, press submit: the system will give feedback."
511.6527245044708,"Let's start from Basel. Shall we go to Bern? Now, it is your turn. If you think we should
connect them, agree with me by pressing the check. Otherwise, disagree with the cross!"
534.9070308208466,"Great, you agree. Then, what should we pick next? Go ahead and suggest the
connection we should pick, by clicking on a mine and dragging to another."
557.020781993866,"Then, you think we should go from Interlaken to Zermatt."
566.513786315918,"Okay, I think it is a good one too!"
575.2612657546997,"Then, shall we go from Zermatt to Montreux?"
586.5594689846039,"Great to see that you agree.
Now it is your turn: Make a guess! What do you think I will do now?"
603.5228896141052,"I see, you think I would connect Montreux to Neuchatel."

Now, make a guess! What do you think I will do now?"
767.0444107055664,"I see that you think we are done, and you want to submit."
772.181812286377,"Oh, the system checked our connection: it seems we can spend less!"
779.7209694385529,Let's try again!
