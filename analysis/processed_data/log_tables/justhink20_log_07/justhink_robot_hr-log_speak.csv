0.0,"Hello! My name is Q.T., and here is my friend Utku. Let's start when you are ready!"
14.063044786453247,"Look at this! This is a map of Switzerland. You see many mountains, and in all of  the mountains there is gold! You also see buildings, but they are not important."
31.092193603515625,"In this game, we have to build a railway network to help the miners go from any mine to any other. Our goal is to spend as little money as possible to build the railways."
46.34547448158264,"Before we play together, let's see how to interact with the game. You see here two gold mines, with a possible connection between them, shown as a gray track."
61.40197563171387,"Let's connect these two gold mines to each other, so that the miners can travel between them. For this, click on one mine, and go to the other without releasing!"
81.46408724784851,"This railway costs 3 francs! In this game we consider the costs of the tracks: every time we build a track, it costs something. We want to spend as little as we can."
100.4940094947815,"Now, imagine you want to remove the connections and start connecting again from  scratch. For this, you can press the eraser button on the right. Try it!"
117.53103303909302,"Now, there is no connection between the mountains: miners can't go between them. Let's connect again, and when you are done, propose your connection by pressing the submit button!"
141.1143295764923,Perfect! You got a hold of it. We can begin!
150.89142751693726,"Now, letâ€™s start the game! Go ahead and connect the gold mines to each other so that miners can go from any mine to any other by some path."
164.8803596496582,"Try to spend as little as possible to build the tracks. Please give it a try by yourself, later, we will do it together!"
285.2394802570343,"Okay, so, let's try to connect these different gold mines to help the miners go between them. Try to spend as few francs as you can. Give it a try!"
340.1439735889435,"So you are done with the second one. What about these gold mines? Let's connect  them as cheaply as possible, while miners can travel between them. Go ahead!"
413.4355673789978,"Okay, let's try for this one now. Please connect them while spending as little as possible. There is only one more to go before we do it together. Good luck!"
453.16790866851807,"So, for this final time, please connect these different mines as cheaply as you can, by yourself. Then, we will play together!"
489.0988600254059,"Now, we do it together! We need to connect the mines, so that miners can travel from any mine to any other. Our goal is to spend as few francs as possible to build tracks!"
506.64191818237305,"We have got only four attempts to find the cheapest connection, so let's try our best! When you think it is ready to be submitted, press submit: the system will give feedback."
525.7157242298126,"Let's start from Basel. Shall we go to Bern? Now, it is your turn. If you think we should connect them, agree with me by pressing the check. Otherwise, disagree with the cross!"
548.970427274704,"Great, you agree. Then, what should we pick next? Go ahead and suggest the connection we should pick, by clicking on a mine and dragging to another."
571.0843060016632,"Then, you think we should go from Interlaken to Zermatt."
580.5767521858215,"Okay, I think it is a good one too!"
589.3244981765747,"Then, shall we go from Zermatt to Montreux?"
600.6228427886963,Great to see that you agree. Now it is your turn: Make a guess! What do you think I will do now?
617.5862004756927,"I see, you think I would connect Montreux to Neuchatel."
626.8807637691498,"Okay, I think it is a good one too!"
635.6033022403717,"Then, shall we go from Neuchatel to Interlaken?"
653.4146797657013,"Okay, you disagree, then you don't think it is a good connection. Now, make a guess! What do you think I will do now?"
671.2307374477386,"I see, you think I would connect Zurich to Luzern."
680.7546784877777,"Definitely, that's a good choice!"

764.9632155895233,"Okay, you disagree, then you don't think it is a good connection. Now, make a guess! What do you think I will do now?"
781.1078732013702,"I see that you think we are done, and you want to submit."
786.2449269294739,"Oh, the system checked our connection: it seems we can spend less!"
793.7839584350586,Let's try again!

972.7765998840332,"I see you do not agree. Then, what is best to do now?"
985.4417698383331,"Then, you think we should go from Luzern to Zermatt."
994.4731993675232,I disagree with you! Shouldn't we go from Luzern to Bern instead?
1008.4934811592102,"Great, You agree with me! Then, its your turn, which mines should we connect?"
1029.2954349517822,"I see, you want to connect Bern to Basel."

1120.1048140525818,Perfect! Congratulations! We connected them while spending as little as possible!
1133.6906135082245,"Now we play again, this time for different connections! Our goal is the same: connecting them while spending as little as we can."
